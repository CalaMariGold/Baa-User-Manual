Invite Baa to your server
------------

To invite Baa, you must be a $3 or more Patron on CalaMariGold's Patreon. 
Connect your Patreon account to Discord and join the Shinycord server, Baa's home:
`Shinycord <https://calamari.gold/discord/>`_.

Once you're in the server and have your Patreon role (which should be given automatically), type this in the **#baas-playground** channel
.. code-block:: console

   !botaccess addserver <server ID>

`server ID` is the ID of the server you own and want to invite Baa to. To get your server ID, right click on the icon of your server and click "Copy ID".

.. note::

   If you decide to cancel your Patreon subscription, Baa will leave your server after a **1 week grace period**. This is because Baa's servers cost money to keep online and that price increases for each server the bot is on.

.. note::

   CalaMariGold, or anyone on Shinycord will not have access to your server through Baa.
